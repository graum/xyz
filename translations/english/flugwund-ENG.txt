the world
here yours alike
spins to pure white
with its cloudbands
in an orbit
our verse, universe

throbs your brow
below the wet cap
jet set ahead of running currents

to altogether forget
fractured on the sink
in a hand
are flowers too white
to change to blue
in yours

steps strike heartbeats, beat
or seconds even, flight sore
we strum, pass up commandments, in strict time
sixty to sole, ceramic, glaze

the best place inside foreign body
the oral cavity
