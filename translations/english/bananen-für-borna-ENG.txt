the seeds are blown towards the bridge
field poppy, clover, the last rapeseed
from the balcony the gaze travels far
forest edge and banana-ripening-plant
green by ethylene to yellow
a thousand nautical miles later
the refinement takes place on site
of the consumer's stand:
good since fresh
the peel like sleek plastic
sterile fruit body, sits perfect in the hand
make
more bananas for Borna
