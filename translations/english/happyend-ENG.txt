i did listen to all the tapes
labeled
sorted and put away
there was nothing there

just airplane sounds in the background

loose boards
then a drizzle
directly into the fields

we scooter
collide
in red in blue in green
we flash
intertwined behaviour 
of bodies driven into a wall
hasty this is how you are with me
and me with you

in the forest distributions
where construction shall take place
or directly into the fields
excavation
sunset through the cloud massif
recitative this is how it used to be
the grass line chewed up
shrouded green

airplanes
a notion
