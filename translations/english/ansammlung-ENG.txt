cluster 

two flags
open up expanse
your blond hair spread out
in the car park
falling towards daylight time.

when all are off
attuning

then
driving faster under ground
to where the least is to be had
where halls lie stark
on generous planes
(pavementrapport)
where time does not matter at all
there
we are allowed
to run down patterns.

the horizon a low threshold
collects us.

nervous characters
serve up
group cluster
on pavement honeycombs
endless
to the cloud tableau.
