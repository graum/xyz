two parallels will intersect
in infinity
two parallels will intersect
in infinity

both eyes wide
open both
sight lines intersect
in the counterpart

slight squint
platinum blonde
gold tooth
a bird in the hand

i know many people
i decided
to not meet them any longer

when it gets dark
i go night-blind
in one eye
usually it is the right one
