light crushed - curves, straight lines
in compact space - henceforth & end
glass fibre far - point, toss, suspended
broken bunch - lukewarm, off & on
red light curves round corners - vein up to the heart
steering, in safety - think oneself and gone again
estates flicker in absence - artery, pulse, stroke, second
ends up confused - bundle, fan, bulb
redemptive genuflexion - plunge into cover
here & now - intervals brief
and the end is nigh - plastic bag, bug out bag
paracord & nylon - spirits, black & full of function
the eye as far as darkness - here today sheer future
