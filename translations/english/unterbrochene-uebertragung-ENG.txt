barely then
as well de-spoken

i speak broken
not german

i speak broken
the language
in pieces, in chunks
a crack

it stumbles on
it's last leg
in the ruinous
sentence

more glass than beech
more hairdryer than tub
he honorable donkey is i

barely then
is also promised misspoken

barely then
as well
