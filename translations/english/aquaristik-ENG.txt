between the plants
in swirling green
the fish scurry
unless:
they are in the mood
& feed on their children
later:
light-finned rest
in the scrub
certain:
i conduct biotope-aquaristics
only sleep well by the pumping click
at the pools edge:
inhale deeply, immerse, float
on the sofa the idea touches
it would be good to have sex tonight
did you know:
to stay awake longer in the evening
signifies dusk to the fish
