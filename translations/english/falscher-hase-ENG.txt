handle with care
candle with hair
candle with hare
handle with hare
handle to ear
trouble with hare
hare dead.
stock pot.

The hare is dead, the hare is dead /
The hair is dead, the hair is dead
it can not coo no more
cocodicocoda
it never coo could
neither hare not there
whats that supposed to be anyway
