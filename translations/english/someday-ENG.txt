Someday I'll wish upon a star

the crude oil's gloss on water surface
strikes circles, peacock feathers, tar
like rainbow
somewhere over
way up high
here by the mirror doubled to a ring

patterns, shape, you realise concentric
proceeding from a pebble's impact point
rushing away to the shore
chiming the brink, after all drops
have fallen in
children scream, growing up
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby

Here
while the boulder is sinking
with its sandstone layers
down to the bed
in slush pale green, turquoise
two bodies high and upright under water
no bluebirds above
eagles circling
Why then, oh why can't I?

seven lakes
wind comes up at this one
and branches down
presses them and tears blossoms away
almost silent in flight movement
of wide wings
vigilantly floating above ground
viewed, targeted and scanned
radioed in with no hearing
condemned here
with delicate glasses heat seeking
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

from notion to target
premonition pointless, a nation under god
everything else defenceless
skies are blue
beneath blue skies

summer's day
jet trails
are cirrus clouds
not even a pyrrhic victory
And wake up where the clouds are far
behind me

That's where you'll find me
against nature
against better judgment
the presumption of innocence
against
back at the lake where strangers meet
more than light falls through the clouds
And the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true
